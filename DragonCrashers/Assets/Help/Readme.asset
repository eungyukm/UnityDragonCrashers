  sections:
  - heading: About this project
    text: "This official sample project showcases Unity\u2019s UI Toolkit for runtime
      games and UI Builder workflows. Inspired by the 2D side-scrolling idle RPG
      demo Dragon Crashers, it uses the UI Toolkit with UXML and USS files to recreate
      common game interface layouts and styles, showing both simple and more advanced
      use cases for the UI Toolkit."
